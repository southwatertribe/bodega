# Bodega

This is a personal project I am working on. It allows users to buy and sell homemade goods locally from their own house. I thought of the idea when I was selling cookies from my kitchen in LA, following cottage food laws. 
Ultimately the user will provide a location and all registered shops by other users within a certain radius will appear. The user can then tap to the corresponding shop profile and make an order for collection. The app is free to use and will only charge people who want to set up a shop. 
Shop owners can open a virtual shop, designed in the way they see fit and even have followers for their local shop. The idea behind this is to create a local community.

To do until MVP
1. Set up the UI and state management DONE
2. Setup a database that can store shops and projecs DONE
3. Allow user authentication and login DONE
4. Enable google maps so people can get directions to shops IN PROGRESS

Additional Steps
1.Allow for not only foods but other handmade items that can be managed on the app
2.Make a cleaner UI
3. Change architecture to scale
4. Enable the option to host events as well within the local community
